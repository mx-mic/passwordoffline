              <h3>Here are the release notes of version 3.0, which can also be viewed <a href=https://github.com/MX-Mic/PasswordOffline/releases/tag/v3.0>here.</a></h3><p><em>Listen, you lovely people! I started this project two years ago, just as a basic command-line file. Thanks to my increasing knowledge in the Windows codebase, PasswordOffline has evolved from that one tiny file, to a full-on program with a setup wizard, high-quality icons and better RAM usage! I want to thank you for sticking around here, and as the new year has approached I will try and start to release more versions and fixes. You are all lovely! </em> <br>
                Release notes <br>
              -Bug fixes, and when I say bug fixes, I mean BUG FIXES!!!! (basically means mountains of bugs removed) <br>
              -Fixed some UI errors <br>
              -Changed title to a much cleaner, shorter one. <br>

Read our security advisories for unsupported versions for more info, located here. I thought making the version number 3.1, but with all the flaws from the last versions I decided to release a big update, hence version 4.0! </em> <br>                
                Release notes: <br>
                -Setup wizard enhancements <br>
                -Somehow Windows XP now works with this program. I do not recommend you use this OS on real hardware anymore, but you can try it out for yourself in a VM if you want to see PasswordOffline working in Windows XP! <br>
                -Added 'components' to setup wizard (non-portable version). Pick from full, compact, or custom, with a choice of programs bundled with PasswordOffline <br>
                -Fixed setup wizard bugs <br>
                -Improved wizard steps during setup <br>

In this release, we have a mountain full of things changed, including the notorious bug/issue #8 fixed! Party in the discussion thread, and enjoy! Also enjoy a brand new, squeaky clean and shiny HTML page, which you can view in the directory PasswordOffline, or tick the box to open it when you install PasswordOffline! </em> <br>
                  <strong>Website Updates</strong>: <br>
                  Improved website design and layout for better readability and presentation. <br>
                  Added alignment and font styles to enhance the visual appeal of the content. <br>
                  Updated the image size to make it more prominent and visually appealing. <br>
                  Added a favicon for a personalized touch to the website. <br>
                  Integrated a Discord widget for easy access to our community and support. <br>
                  Made adjustments to the Discord widget positioning for better alignment with other elements. <br id="latest">
                <em>While it may look a little worse, or better than before, the transition to HTML has allowed further possibilities with our website, like the favicon, which was impossible for us to implement with Markdown! We hope you enjoy the improved website experience and find it more convenient to navigate and access the necessary information. If you have any feedback or suggestions regarding the website, please feel free to reach out to us at micxsterbusiness@gmail.com. Your input is valuable in helping us improve PasswordOffline further. </em> <br>
                  
                  <strong>Thank you for your continued support! </strong> <br>
                  
                  <strong>The full release notes:</strong> <br>
                  Changed icon to be more readable and less blinding <br>
                  Fixed copyright notice, to actually include a copyright notice and not a license to fork the project <br>
                  Improved grammar in read-me files EVEN MORE! <br>
                  Fixed a load of setup bugs <br>
                  Changed grammar in actual program <br>
                  Fixed alignment and output of text <br>
                  Actually fixed the generation of passwords (#8), but as you all will know, a new bug came out just after I fixed the other blummin' one! <br>
                  Changed title and description of executable to be more readable and identifiable in Task Manager, the taskbar, Alt+Tab switcher and other places! <br>
                  Fixed file information <br>
                  Fixed HTML! Not just the bug (#11), but also the actual page so it doesn't look like an old bloke in a garden shed made it in 2 minutes! <br>
                  Removed 'PasswordOffline on the web' option, partly due to issue #11, but also because it's almost impossible to implement for end-users who installed without administrator privileges (just installed to their AppData folder, or maybe even externally, but I don't see the point, why couldn't they just download the specific portable version?) <br>
                  Improved memory usage even more! <br>
                  Sped up processing time! <br>
                  Fixed a volcano full of other things!</p></div><div class="figure">
