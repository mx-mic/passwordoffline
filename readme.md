## Welcome!
#### Thank you for your interest in PasswordOffline
PasswordOffline is a secure password generator. You can read why it's secure on the [security policy document](https://github.com/MX-Mic/PasswordOffline/security/policy).

### Where did the releases go?
As part of removing sensitive information from our repository, we decided to delete our exisitng repository, so wait until our next release. This is because GitHub won't let us remove individual commits.

### License
PasswordOffline is currently protected under copyright law and I ([MX-Mic](https://github.com/MX-Mic)) have no plans to change this in the future. _Then why is it on GitHub then?_ (you may ask). The reason is that it's easy to use and allows people to see the version history, and also download older releases for testing purposes. I am not going to take you to court for forking my repository (if that's even possible), I just won't allow you to distribute and publish your own versions or copy my work. [That's all copyright law is](https://www.gov.uk/copyright) (well, not exactly, I don't think). You can read more about PasswordOffline and copyright nowhere at the moment, because our website isn't finished.

### How do I use PasswordOffline
_Website not finished_
