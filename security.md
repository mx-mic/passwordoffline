## Information on our security practices
#### This document explains how PasswordOffline is secure and what to do to keep it that way.
##### If you have any suggestions to make to this document, please read the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/MX-Mic/PasswordOffline/blob/main/contributing.md) and the [community rules](https://github.com/MX-Mic/PasswordOffline/blob/main/code_of_conduct.md).

### PasswordOffline's main security feature
PasswordOffline is an offline-only tool, which means the application has absolutly no access to the internet at all. Therefore, passwords and passcodes you generate inside the app aren't sent to anyone and are only visible by yourself, or anyone looking at your computer screen.

_I want more info!_

When you use PasswordOffline, the passwords and passcodes that get randomly generated aren't sent anywhere. It isn't even stored on your local hard disk! That's why you should write it down somewhere private in case you forget it. In technical terms, the passwords are only available to the RAM, which stores the Console Window Host/Command Prompt program in it temporarily while PasswordOffline is on the `Your randomly generated [code(s)] is/are:` page. If lots of people use your (or you are using another person's) computer, we highly recommend that you close PasswordOffline once your done using it.
