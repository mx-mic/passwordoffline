Thank you for installing PasswordOffline! We hope you enjoy the most secure password generator.

To make a selection, type the number of your choice. For example, if you want to generate a password, type in '1' (without the quotation marks). Another example is if you want to shut down you're computer after making a selection, type '5'. If you want to, you can also type it in with the closing bracket at the end, like this: '5)'. This works for any selection you make!
