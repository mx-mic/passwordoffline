Frequently asked questions:
Q: My antivirus and/or Windows SmartScreen flagged this program as potentially malicious. Is the program actually safe?
A: Yes, PasswordOffline is safe. The application is designed to never transmit or recieve any data apart from when you finish the 
setup wizard (this is because it opens up a HTML file with images it has to download from GitHub's usercontent/CDN servers).

Q: Are my generated passwords safe?
A: Yes, the passwords and passcodes PasswordOffline generates don't go anywhere, and are discarded whenever you make another 
selection or close the program, so you must use common sense and note them down in 'your' secure place.

Q: I would like to give feedback or request/enquire something, how can I go about doing this?
A: Just look in the discussion thread for anything related to feedback and requests, or just make a new one! The forum site is:
